# 'r' It opens the file for reading only
# 'w' Opens file for writing. If file doesn't exist, it creates one
# 'x' Creates a new file. If file exist, the operation fails
# 'a' Open in append mode.  If file doesn't exist, it creates one
# 'b' Open in binary mode
# '+' Will open a file for reading and writing. Good for updating
